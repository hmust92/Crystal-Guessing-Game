# Crystal Game!

A web application created using HTML, CSS and Javascript and the jQuery library. The purpose of the game is to use the crystals to guess the number the computer has provided you. Each crystal per session will represent a number. You will click on the crystals until your guesses add up to the computer's number.   

The live link is at the top of the main repo page.
